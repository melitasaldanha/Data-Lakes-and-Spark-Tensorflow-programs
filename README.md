# README

## Objective:
- Study a single big data library or tool, in-depth
- Analytic problem solving from Spark and Tensorflow perspectives

## Details:
1. **Part I:** Data Lakes
    
2.  **Part II:** Programs solved using Spark and Tensorflow 
    - Single Pass Matrix Multiplication using Map Reduce
    - Tensorflow code to define the linear regression model and perform gradient descent over its beta parameters using momentum optimization
    - Prove that if the Jaccard  similarity of two sets is 0 then the estimate one would get from minhashing always yields 0
    - Design a Spark-based solution to produce a signature matrix using efficient minhashing
